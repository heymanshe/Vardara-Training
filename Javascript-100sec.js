/* 
# Javascript high-level, single-threaded, garbage-collected, interpreted or JIT(ust-In-Time) complied, 
  prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language with a non-blocking event loop.
# Created in 1995 in just one week by BRENDAN EICH with the goal of adding an easy 
  to learn scripting language to the netscape browser it was originally named mocha.
# Atwood's Law- Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript
# it's a single threaded language made possible by a non-blocking event loop that can queue up work in the 
  background without blocking the main thread 
# javascript is often used to grab an element from the dom document
